What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
The browser turns the hostname into an IP address using DNS. Browser then makes a request to that 
IP address. The server then responds and will respond with a code depending on its condition (200 is 
ok, 404 is an error).  The browser will then find any other resources the page provides and puts it
in a DOM. The browser will make separate HTTP requests for each of those resources and will receive
a response for each from the server. -->
